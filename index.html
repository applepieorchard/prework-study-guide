        <h2>HTML</h2>
        <ul>
          <li>&lt;head&gt; - contains information, or metadata, that helps the browser to render the page correctly. Elements included within the &lt;head&gt; are not visible when a user looks at a webpage.
          </li>
          <li>&lt;body&gt; - contains the content that is shown to the user. All the elements that we want the user to see and interact with must be placed inside this element.
          </li>
          <li>&lt;!DOCTYPE&gt; - This declaration tells the browser what document type it should expect when it is opened. This particular &lt;!DOCTYPE html&gt; declaration is letting the browser know to expect HTML on the page. 
            <ul>
              <li>&lt;!DOCTYPE&gt; is not case-sensitive because it is a declaration. Declarations are not case-sensitive; HTML elements are case-sensitive.
              </li>
            </ul>
          </li>
          <li>&lt;html&gt; - opening tag, which represents the root, or start, of our HTML document.
            <ul>
              <li>&lt;html lang="en"&gt; - Inside the &lt;html&gt; tag is an attribute of lang="en", which tells the browser the language for the webpage
              </li>
              <li>An HTML attribute defines additional information about an element. 
              </li>
              <li>HTML attributes are always defined in the beginning element, never the closing element.
              </li>
            </ul>
          </li>          
          <li>&lt;title&gt; - defines the title for a webpage. This element is required and is extremely important for Search Engine Optimization (SEO).
          </li>
          <li>&lt;style&gt; - defines the CSS styles associated with a website.
          </li>
          <li>&lt;base&gt; - defines the base URL for a webpage.
          </li>
          <li>&lt;link&gt; - connects an external resource to the HTML document.
          </li>
          <li>&lt;meta&gt; - defines metadata such as the character set, description, keywords, author, and viewport.
            <ul>
              <li>&lt;meta charset="UTF-8" /&gt; -  defines the charset, or character set, as UTF-8, which allows us to use most characters and symbols on the page.
              </li>
              <li>&lt;meta http-equiv="X-UA-Compatible" content="IE=edge"&gt; - The http-equiv element sets an HTTP header for content.
              </li>
              <li>&lt;meta name="viewport" content="width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0"&gt; - The viewport element sets the default view for our webpage.
              </li>
            </ul>
          </li>
          <li>&lt;script&gt; - embeds client-side scripts in the HTML document.
          </li>
          <li>&lt;body&gt; - defines the body of the document, which contains the content that is visible to the user. All of the content that we want to display to users must be inside the &lt;body&gt; element.
            <ul>
              <li>The &lt;body&gt; element is an example of a semantic HTML element. In semantic HTML elements, the name of the element describes its content and the role it plays on a webpage. When possible, it is important to use semantic HTML elements, because they make your HTML easier to read by other developers and the browser. Semantic HTML also plays an important role in making sure your webpage is accessible to the widest variety of users, including those who use assistive technologies such as screen readers.
              </li>
              <li>Not all elements are semantic, though. It is still common to see non-semantic elements such as &lt;div&gt; to create a division in the page, or &lt;span&gt; to create an inline division. Sometimes these are simply the most efficient solution to a structural problem the developer is trying to solve. The most important thing to keep in mind is that it is best practice to use semantic elements whenever possible, especially when the content is visible to users.
              </li>

          <li>&lt;h1&gt; - Headings, listed bellow

              </li>
              <li>width= - defines the width of the image
              </li>
              <li>height= - defines the height of the image
              </li>
            </ul>
          </li>
          <li>&lt;br&gt; - creates a line break
          </li>
          <li>&lt;a&gt; - anchor, will link to another url when clicked
            <ul>
              <li>href= - destination url of the anchor
              </li>
            </ul>
          </li>
          <li>&lt;main&gt; - A Quick Search said the following: specifies the main content of a document. The content inside the &lt;main&gt; element should be unique to the document. It should not contain any content that is repeated across documents such as sidebars, navigation links, copyright information, site logos, and search forms.
          </li>
          <li>&lt;footer&gt; - appears at the bottom of the page and usually contains the author, copyright, contact, sitemap, and navigation.
          </li>
          <li>&lt;section&gt; - semantic elements that define a section in a document that contains thematic content.
            <ul>
              <li>id= - a way to identify elements and select them.
              </li>
              <li>class= - this works in a similar way to the id, will be clarified later 
              </li>
            </ul>
          </li>
        </ul>

      </section>
   
      <section class="card" id="css-section">
        <h2>CSS</h2>
        <ul>
          <li>margin -  acts much like a margin in a word processing document. A margin property indicates how much space we want around the outside of an element. The margin is not visible on the page; it merely adds a buffer. When we set the margin property to 0, we are indicating that we want NO extra space around the element.
          </li>
          <li>padding - is often confused with margin, but it is not the same thing. The padding property adds space around the content inside an element. When you increase padding, you are actually making the entire element bigger! That is because the padding, while transparent, is located inside the element, whereas the margin is the transparent buffer outside an element.
          </li>
          <li>.card - an example of a class selector, the class in this case is card. Any HTML element assigned to the class, card, will gain these property assignments from the CSS.
          </li>
          <li>width - defines the width of the element
          </li>
          <li>border - a box element between the margin and the padding
          </li>
          <li>boxshadow - adds shadow effects around an element's frame. You can set multiple effects separated by commas. A box shadow is described by X and Y offsets relative to the element, blur and spread radius, and colour. In our example, the X offset is 5px and defines the width or extent of the shadow on the X axis (or to the right of the box); the Y offset is 10px and defines the extent on the Y axis (or just below the box). We haven’t defined the blur or spread radius here, but you’ll learn more about this in time. We’ve used an HTML hexadecimal code to define the colour.

          </li>
          <li>Operators
            <ul>
              <li>Addition (+) - Add two numbers together or combine two strings.
              </li>
              <li>Subtraction (-), Multiplication (*), Division (/) - basic maths
              </li>
              <li>Assignment (=) - assigns a value to a variable.
              </li>
              <li>Strict Equality (===) - This performs a test to see if two values are equal and of the same data type. It returns a true/false (Boolean) result.
              </li>
              <li>Not (!) - This returns the logically opposite value of what it precedes.
              </li>
              <li>Does not equal (!==) - When it is used alongside the Equality operator, the negation operator tests whether two values are not equal.
              </li>
            </ul>
          </li>
          <li>Conditionals - are code structures used to test if an expression returns true or not. A very common form of conditionals is the if...else statement.
            <ul>
              <li>if - the first condition of a conditional statement
              </li>
              <li>else if - subsequent conditions if the first condition is falsy, the computer will continue to check for these until it finds one that is truthy, after which it will execute the code in the curly brackets and break out of the if statement
              </li>
            </ul>
          </li>
          <li>Functions - are a way of packaging functionality that you wish to reuse. It's possible to define a body of code as a function that executes when you call the function name in your code. This is a good alternative to repeatedly writing the same code.
            <ul>
              <li>a block of code that only executes when it is called upon instead of immediately like if statements or for loops.                
              </li>
              <li>If you see something which looks like a variable name, but it's followed by parentheses— () —it is likely a function. Functions often take arguments: bits of data they need to do their job. Arguments go inside the parentheses, separated by commas if there is more than one argument. For example, the alert() function makes a pop-up box appear inside the browser window, but we need to give it a string as an argument to tell the function what message to display.
              </li>              
            </ul>
          </li>
          <li>Events - websites need these to be interactive, they listen for activity and run code in response
          </li>
          <li>JSON - my beloved JSON i know JSON i love JSON
            <ul>
              <li>a lightweight data-interchange format, derived from JavaScript, but used by many programming languages. JSON builds universal data structures that can be transferred between different environments and even across languages.
              </li>
            </ul>
          </li>
          <li>Type Coercion - JavaScript is a weakly typed language. This means that you can often use a value of one type where another type is expected, and the language will convert it to the right type for you. To do so, JavaScript defines a handful of coercion rules.
            <ul>
              <li>Primitive coercion - is used where a primitive value is expected, but there's no strong preference for what the actual type should be. This is usually when a string, a number, or a BigInt are equally acceptable.
              </li>
              <li>Numeric coercion - Sometimes the language specifically expects a number or a BigInt, other times, it may tolerate either and perform different operations depending on the operand's type.
              </li>
              <li>Other coercions - All data types, except Null, Undefined, and Symbol, have their respective coercion process.
              </li>
            </ul>
          </li>
          <li>Falsy - A value is considered falsy if it is one of the following values: 0, -0, On, "", null, undefined, NaN, or a Boolean data type with the value of false.            
          </li>
          <li>Truthy - All other values, including a Boolean with the value of true, are considered truthy.
          </li>
          <li>Control Flow - is the order in which a computer executes code in a file. Typically, JavaScript code is executed from top to bottom. However, using conditional statements such as if statements allows us to interrupt control flow.
          </li>
          <li>for - a loop that uses the predictable pattern of indices to perform a task on all the items in an array by allowing a single code block to be executed over and over. Developers must use another statement, such as the conditional if statement that we just learned, to interrupt the control flow by executing a block of code a specific number of times.
